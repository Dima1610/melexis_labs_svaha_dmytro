Question 2.1

Advantages: 

-much easier and faster to describe complex logic.

-this modeling style is easier in using and understanding.

Disadvantages:

-synthesizer create optimized schemes and they can be not like you need.



Question 2.2

Advantages:

-a more accurate circuit than in the behavioral style of writing.

-synthesizer generates the same scheme described in the code.

Disadvantages:

-very large-volume projects.

-Any small mistake leads to erratic operation of the circuit.



Question 2.3

To describe some standart cells, blocks, use behavioral design style. But also some designers use struct design style when they want to 
describe some scheme which synthesizer can`t build right. And designer can combine this styles in project. 



Question 2.4

Generate construct is more powerful than conditional compilation with `ifdef statement, 
because generate may allow (if, case) and for-loops. And generate construct more comfortable than `ifdef to describe,
some param modules.
